================================================
-----[content the mod has, yes in detail.]------
================================================

*  2 full weeks with new character(s), along with a lot of side songs in Freeplay, and a couple of covers
*  kinda animated?? cutscenes for songs on both story mode n freeplay
*  a whole lotta lore

btw tho vs br still isnt ready just yet, but dont worry we be workin nonstop to get it all done while keeping it ä̵̰̳͇́n̴̪̄̆ ̴͈̈́̀̒ȇ̷̉͠ͅn̵̻̿͌ͅǰ̶͔̚ō̵͍̔y̴̡̙̑̒ä̵̹̹̇b̸̬̈̏͠͠ͅl̷̘̰̠̎ȅ̶̼̣͕́̂ ̷̬͉̚e̸̺̅̾̐x̸̨̛̝͙̖p̸͎̑̅͛̚e̵̢͔͈̾͗͝r̴͕̜̝͛͘ȉ̵̦̞̺̔e̶̢͎̲̩̋̀́n̴͙͎̒̇͝c̶̡͙̘̀̅e̵̞̊̿!̴̬͚͋̉͊   so we hope you'll stay tuned for allat!

oh yeah, probly should also mention that the majority of this stuff is made on mobile, content-wise, the code doesn't count tho lol

so um... yeah thats pretty much it, tysm for playing the build n we hope u get hyped up for the final build of v1!

========================================
-----[extra notes just in case lol]-----
========================================

*  the first song in the first week does not have vocals but thats cuz it hasnt been worked yet. oh well

*  again a lot of the content isnt done yet, like most of the freeplay songs, and the 2nd week (theres gonna be a second song but its not done so i hid it for now so u can unlock freeplay)

*  theres a lotta bugs n glitches in this mod, but thats cuz the mod is still being worked on actively. let me know if u spot em hehehehehe

*  i get the whole file digging (data mining) thing, but this thing is supposed to be like a surprise though so checking the files without actually playing the build, kinda ruins the experience (there is a lot in it??)

*  i hope you have fun and thx for playtesting the mod!! appreciation has been given

aight bye
