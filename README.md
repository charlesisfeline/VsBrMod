hi

[site](https://charlesisfeline.github.io/vsbr/)

## what engine is this for

codename engine, the 2nd best fnf engine lol, made by [the codename crew](https://github.com/CodenameCrew)

its character editor is shit tho, use a Psych to Codename converter or a custom offset editor for now until when they finish the stage editor

(btw we made this with a modified version of codename engine, if ur wondering)

## HOW TO PLAY

- get [codename engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine/actions)
- extract it
- download the repo and put it into le ``mods/`` folder, simple enough
- play it and badabing badaboom u got vs br
