## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating such a positive environment
include:

-   Usage of welcoming and inclusive language.
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
-   Focusing on what is best for our community.
-   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances.
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
-   Public or private harassment.
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, or a phone number, without explicit permission.
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this guide, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This guide applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at . All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this guidein good faith may face temporary/permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Reporting Bugs and Crashes

When reporting an issue, make sure to always report one issue per bug/crash.
If you notice several bugs and you want to report them, I'd highly recommend making **seperate issues for all of them**.

Issues are often reported a bunch, so please go check to see if your issue already exists before reporting them.
You can search them first [here](https://github.com/charlesisfeline/VsBrMod/issues), by the way.

If you don't find a relevant match or if you're just unsure, do not hesitate to **open a new issue**.

## Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the mod/engine, make sure that:

-   The contribution does not affect performance significantly. You can ignore this rule if
    your PR does not alter much code in any way.
-   Your PR is useful for future work by another developer, regardless of it not getting merged.
-   Document every change. If your pull requests add methods that others may not understand in a way,
    please add a comment that briefly explains them.
-   If the PR is made to resolve an issue, please link the original.
